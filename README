= ABOUT =

TooTwi is a python library for Twitter API, intended to be truly object-oriented, extendible and fast.


= FEATURES =

* Streams s iterators.
* OAuth and basic auth (still allowed in streams).
* A lot of properly designed data models with mutual relations.
* Easyness of inheritance and enhancement.


= CODE SAMPLES = 

Working code samples are in test-models.py and test-stream.py.

Models:

	from tootwi import API
	from tootwi.models import Status, User, PublicTimeline, Account
	from tootwi.credentials import OAuthConsumerCredentials, OAuthAccessCredentials
	from tootwi.connections import urllib2Connection

	connection = urllib2Connection()
	credentials = OAuthAccessCredentials('...', '...', '...', '...')
	api = API(credentials, connection)

	user = Account(api).verify_credentials()
	print(user)

	timeline = PublicTimeline(api)
	print(timeline[0])
	for status in timeline: print(status)

	Status(api, text='hello world at %s' % datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")).update()
	Status(api, text='bye world at %s'   % datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")).update()


Streams:

	from tootwi import API
	from tootwi.streams import SampleStream, FilterStream, MessageFactory
	from tootwi.credentials import OAuthConsumerCredentials, OAuthAccessCredentials
	from tootwi.connections import urllib2Connection

	connection = urllib2Connection()
	credentials = OAuthAccessCredentials('...', '...', '...', '...')
	api = API(credentials, connection)

	for item in FilterStream(api, MessageFactory(), follow=[16132160,313826855]):
		print(item)

	for item in SampleStream(api, MessageFactory()):
		print(item)



= HISTORY AND STATUS =

This library is a byproduct of a few experiments with Twitter API and streams.
There is a library with even more features and API coverage: "tweepy" (http://tweepy.github.com/).
At the moment of the experiments it has been moving to another repository, thus poorly searchable.
And it is still completely not documented unless you read its code. No wonder why I've missed it.
I have no intentions to continue this library development unless there will be public interest.


= CREDENTIALS IN THE CODE =

Sensitive credentials in the code are of a test account and a test app.
And they are intentionally not removed to make prototyping easier.
Probably they are already deleted to the moment you read it.
